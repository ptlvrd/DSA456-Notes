Comprehensive notes on data structures and algorithms
Sure, let's break down the steps for analyzing code performance in a way that's easy to understand.

### Step 0: Show Your Code

First, you put your code so everyone can see it. It's like showing your homework before you start explaining it.

```python
def factorial(number):
    rc = 1
    for i in range(2, number + 1):
        rc = rc * i
    return rc
```

This code calculates the factorial of a number. A factorial is when you multiply a number by all the numbers below it. For example, factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

### Step 1: Explain What Variables and Functions Mean

Next, we explain what the variables and functions mean in the code. Think of it as labeling the parts of a puzzle before putting it together.

- Let **n** be the number we're finding the factorial for.
- Let **T(n)** be the number of steps (operations) our code takes to find the factorial of n.

### Step 2: Count the Steps (Operations)

Now, we count every little step the code takes to do its job. Imagine counting the number of moves you make to solve a puzzle.

1. **Setting up `rc`**: 
   ```python
   rc = 1  # 1 operation
   ```

2. **Setting up the loop**: 
   ```python
   for i in range(2, number + 1):  # (n-1) iterations + 1 for the + operator + 1 for range call
   ```

3. **Multiplying inside the loop**:
   ```python
   rc = rc * i  # 2 operations (multiplication and assignment), (n-1) times
   ```

4. **Returning the result**:
   ```python
   return rc  # 1 operation
   ```

So, let's write this with the counts:

```python
def factorial(number):
    rc = 1  # 1 operation

    for i in range(2, number + 1):  # (n-1) + 1 + 1 = (n-1) + 2
        rc = rc * i  # 2 * (n-1)
    
    return rc  # 1 operation
```

### Step 3: Add Up the Steps

Now, we add up all the steps we counted:

- **Setting up `rc`**: 1 step.
- **Loop setup**: (n-1) + 2 steps.
- **Inside the loop**: 2 * (n-1) steps.
- **Returning the result**: 1 step.

So, the total steps are:

\[ T(n) = 1 + ((n-1) + 2) + (2 \cdot (n-1)) + 1 \]

### Step 4: Simplify the Steps

We simplify the total steps by adding and combining like terms. It’s like tidying up your puzzle pieces.

\[ T(n) = 1 + (n-1) + 2 + 2(n-1) + 1 \]

\[ T(n) = 1 + n - 1 + 2 + 2n - 2 + 1 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ T(n) = 3n + 1 \]

### Step 5: Find the Dominating Term

Finally, we look for the biggest term because as the puzzle (or number n) gets bigger, the smaller pieces don’t matter much.

In \( T(n) = 3n + 1 \), as n becomes very large, the "+1" part doesn’t matter much compared to "3n".

So, we say \( T(n) \) is \( O(n) \).

### Summary

1. **Show the Code**: Display the code you’re analyzing.
2. **Explain Variables**: Define the variables and functions.
3. **Count Steps**: Count the operations in the code.
4. **Add Up Steps**: Combine all the counts into one expression.
5. **Find Dominating Term**: Simplify to find the term that matters most as n gets very large.

This tells us how the code will perform as the size of the input (n) increases. For the factorial function, the steps grow linearly with n, which is called \( O(n) \) in Big-O notation.
